# JWT Spring Security Demo

![Screenshot from running application](etc/screenshot-jwt-spring-security-demo.png?raw=true "Screenshot JWT Spring Security Demo")

## About
This is just a simple demo for using **JWT (JSON Web Token)** with **Spring Security** and
**Spring Boot**. This solution is partially based on the blog entry
[REST Security with JWT using Java and Spring Security](https://www.toptal.com/java/rest-security-with-jwt-spring-security-and-java)
and the demo project [Cerberus](https://github.com/brahalla/Cerberus). Thanks to the authors!

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/szerhusenBC/jwt-spring-security-demo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/szerhusenBC/jwt-spring-security-demo)

## Requirements
This demo is build with with Maven 3 and Java 1.8.

## Usage
Just start the application with the Spring Boot maven plugin (`mvn spring-boot:run`). The application is
running at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

There are three user accounts present to demonstrate the different levels of access to the endpoints in
the API and the different authorization exceptions:
```
Admin - admin:admin
User - user:password
Disabled - disabled:password (this user is disabled)
```

There are three endpoints that are reasonable for the demo:
```
/auth - authentication endpoint with unrestricted access
/persons - an example endpoint that is restricted to authorized users (a valid JWT token must be present in the request header)
/protected - an example endpoint that is restricted to authorized users with the role 'ROLE_ADMIN' (a valid JWT token must be present in the request header)
```

I've written a small Javascript client and put some comments in the code that hopefully makes this demo
understandable.
